# COMP-301-Project-4
This project demonstrates what I learned in my summer class - it is mainly focused on Object-Oriented Programming
Some key concepts are: encapsulation, inheritance, observers/observables, factory pattern methods, exceptions, and basic animations.

Note: This course mandated that we use jdk 11 and a course-specific program called "Object Editor", so it might be unwieldy to run.  Rather, I intend for this repository to demonstrate my comprehension on some fundamental topics about computer science.
